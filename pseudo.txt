AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data



GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application (npm start)
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for USERS and THOUGHTS
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON



WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete USERS and THOUGHTS in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list




1. Main two routes : 
  a. http://localhost:3001/api/users
  b. http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts

2. Crud operations 
  a. GET : users and thoughts from db
  b. POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove) : users and thoughts in/from db
  c. POST (create) and DELETE (remove) : reactions to thoughts
  c. POST (create) and DELETE (remove) : add and remove friends from friend list
